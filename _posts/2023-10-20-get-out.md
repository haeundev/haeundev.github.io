## Gameplay Dynamics
"Get Out" is an audio-based horror escape game designed to enhance hearing sensitivity. In this game, players find themselves in situations where most visual information is deliberately obscured, necessitating reliance on auditory cues to complete quests. Each quest is designed to train sound detection, speech-in-noise perception, and pitch perception skills. To heighten the sense of immersion and presence within the game environment, a physicsbased audio system has been seamlessly integrated.

## Technical Backbone
The key development tools employed include the Unity3D engine (version 2021.3.25f1) and the [Project Acoustics SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/acoustics/what-is-acoustics). Project Acoustics improves upon ray-based acoustics methods by accurately simulating sound wave behavior, accounting for diffraction, and seamlessly translating simulation results into traditional audio parameters for occlusion, portaling, and reverb control. Developers can label the acoustic geometry of the scene by choosing from various materials like glass, carpet, marble, or wood, and these choices influence the acoustic characteristics used during sound processing.

## Strategic Design
In "Get Out," audio sources are strategically scattered throughout the scene, ensuring that players perceive different sounds based on their in-game position and orientation. While traditional game design often prioritizes maximizing visual experiences, this game shifts the focus towards strategically placed auditory cues for gameplay. This innovative approach is poised to deliver substantial benefits to sound engineers, musicians, or anyone seeking to enhance their hearing sensitivity through engaging game-based training.

This project is showcased at the [ASK (The Acoustical Society of Korea) 2023](https://www.ask.or.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=notice&wr_id=275), during the ASK-ASJ joint session.
